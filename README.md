"# DesignPatterns" 
This project presents the implementation of two examples for each of the following categories of design patterns: creational, structural, and behavioral. 
For the creational category, I have implemented Factory Method and Abstract Factory. 
For the structural category, I have implemented Adapter and Proxy. 
For the behavioral category, I have implemented Observer and Strategy. 
Each pattern is implemented in Java and includes a functional example, explaining its use in different contexts to solve common software design problems.
